# Automatic brain parcellation on T1 MR with a high-resolution 3D net

This page describes how to acquire and use the network described in:

Li W., Wang G., Fidon L., Ourselin S., Cardoso M.J., Vercauteren T. (2017)
On the Compactness, Efficiency, and Representation of 3D
Convolutional Networks: Brain Parcellation as a Pretext Task.
In: Information Processing in Medical Imaging. IPMI 2017

This network parcellates 160 types of structures
(including 155 neuroanatomical structures) from brain MR images.
## Downloading model zoo files

The network weights and examples data can be downloaded with the command
```bash
net_download highres3dnet_brain_parcellation_model_zoo
```

(Replace `net_download` with `python net_download.py` if you cloned the NiftyNet repository.)

## Generating segmentations for example data

Generate segmentations for the included example image with the command
```bash
net_segment inference -c ~/niftynet/extensions/highres3dnet_brain_parcellation/highres3dnet_config_eval.ini
```

Replace `net_segment` with `python net_segment.py` if you cloned the NiftyNet repository.
